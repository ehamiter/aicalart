"Impressionist landscape, soft brushstrokes, vibrant colors, full screen, no margins. An outdoor scenery capturing a sense of unity and solidarity on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women juxtaposed against ordinary life moments that include the taking out of trash, a visit to the dentist, football practice at the academy, an anticipated showcase event, and joyous gatherings tinged with holiday spirit- be it the annual parent club update, a tentative Christmas party, or the peace of Christmas Eve. All these elements are carefully woven together in an effort to celebrate life in all its chaos and harmony, with the ever-watchful orange tabby, Hobbes, making an appearance in each scene."
