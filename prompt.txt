"Impressionist landscape with soft brushstrokes and vibrant colors. A bustling outdoor scenery unfolds, the foreground features a homely setting full of life: an orange tabby cat, Hobbes, meticulously taking out a small bag of trash while children are shown practicing in a nearby football academy. Towards the middle ground, depict a hill upon which stands a dental clinic, while farther back a festive city celebrates Christmas and welcomes a new year. Integrating deeply within the visual tapestry, illustrate symbols of strength and peace to commemorate the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women."
