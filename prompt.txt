"Pop Art collage, full screen, bursting with bright colors and consumer culture symbols, infused with ironic sensibility. Show a symbol of a woman, powerful and resilient, breaking chains on one side signifying the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Near her a towering, delectable parfait celebrating National Parfait Day. Scatter about symbols of daily chores like a trash bin. Add inherit emblems of dentist appointments, soccer practices and family meetings. Overlay festive symbols hinting at an approaching holiday season - hints of a birthday cake, Christmas trees and a shroud of the New Year's Eve ball drop. Somewhere, in a midst of this organized chaos, sneak in Hobbes, the orange tabby domestic shorthair cat, engaging in a mundane activity."
