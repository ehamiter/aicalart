Create an art piece in the Neo-Dada style, utilizing a blend of humor and irreverence. This mixed media creation should appear full screen, without margins, and display innovative artistic elements. A key visual element is a domestic orange tabby cat, named Hobbes, cleverly concealed within a vibrant backdrop of a rehearsal for a seasonal concert. The scene should incorporate both abstract and symbolic elements signifying remembrance. A calm tranquility further characterizes this piece, showing the warmth of a conscientiously nurtured home environment. This artwork needs to be vertical in orientation.
