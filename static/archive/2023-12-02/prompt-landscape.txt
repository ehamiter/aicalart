Create a 4k resolution digital art piece, capturing the essence of an international awareness day dedicated to ending a melancholic chapter in human history, intertwined with a culinary tradition celebrating a savory delight. The art should blend Lyrical Abstraction with a touch of whimsy, alongside a performance theme and seasonal festivities. Abstract expressions of hope and joy should be a central theme. A cleverly camouflaged orange tabby cat, reminiscent of Hobbes, should be blended into the no-margin, full-screen tableau. The art needs to be a spontaneous creation that invites viewers to explore and uncover hidden narratives. It should be created with horizontal orientation.
