Create an image inspired by a De Stijl's geometric and abstract style. This image should depict a harmonious society celebrating Rosa Parks Day. Incorporate an abstract representation of an apple into the scene. The scene should also include abstract straight-line renditions of a winter concert. An orange tabby cat should be cleverly woven into this representation to symbolize unity and peace amidst contemporary global occurrences. Make sure the overall feel of the image conveys harmony, peace, and unity. The orientation of the picture should be horizontal. Bear in mind that all human figures included should reflect people of different descents and genders.
