Digital art in 4k resolution, capturing the essence of an international awareness day aimed at ending a dark chapter in human history, merged with a culinary tradition celebrating a savory delight. Incorporating Lyrical Abstraction with a touch of whimsy to include a performance theme and seasonal festivities, the artwork entwines abstract expressions of hope and joy. Hobbes, the orange tabby, is cleverly camouflaged within the no-margin, full-screen tableau, a spontaneous creation that invites viewers to search and uncover hidden stories.
