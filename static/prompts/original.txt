Digital art in 4K resolution, embracing the principles of Neo-plasticism and geometric abstraction, with a limited color palette designed for universal harmony, no margins, and a full screen canvas.

Subtly incorporating the playful silhouette of Hobbes, the orange tabby, to add a layer of warmth and personal touch to the composition.
