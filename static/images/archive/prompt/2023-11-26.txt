"Scandinavian contemporary design featuring an orthodontic office in muted colors with minimalism and functionality. The clean lines are interrupted by an orange cat interacting humorously with dental tools and a toothbrush. In the open drawer, a calendar peeks out indicating a soccer practice ahead. In the corner, a neatly tied trash bag indicates routine chores. Touches of natural materials are incorporated ingeniously hinting towards celebratory events. The overall design fills the screen with no margins, inviting deeper exploration that time and again uncovers new details."
