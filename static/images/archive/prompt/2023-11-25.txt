"Traditional Chinese ink painting, brushwork, mountains, water themes, no margins, full screen: A symphony of life unfolds on a vast landscape. The scene is dominated by craggy mountains symbolizing steadfastness and high lofty aspirations. On their peaks, your loyal cat Hobbes rests, observing the life below and the practice at a football academy on a small plateau. In the valley beneath, water streams carry away everyday waste symbolizing the regular tasks of life - perhaps taking out the trash. Further down, a gathering of friends and family are seen celebrating under blooming peonies, an allusion to birthdays and moments of joy. By the water's edge, a showcase reminiscent of traditional Gatlinburg craftsmen brings the scene to life. Noticeably conspicuous is a group of women standing strong by a willow tree, symbolizing resilience and the elimination of violence against women. The women are seen helping an elderly person, showing respect and care for their elders. The landscape transforms from day to night indicating time's relentless march towards the end of the year festivities, with fireworks illuminating the horizon on the final day of the year."
