"Construct a constructivist, no margins, full-screen masterpiece framing a landscape of mechanical and industrial objects echoing the rhythm of everyday duties: taking out trash, an abstracted sports practice, and a surreal dentist appointment. Lost in this puzzle of geometric shapes, find Hobbes, cleverly camouflaged, reveling on a towering parfait. A bold, central typography states 'Eliminate Violence, Uplift Harmony' symbolizing the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Subtle motifs from the holidays discreetly hidden serve as a rich, iterative exploration. Ensure this image remains simple enough to evoke illustrations from an old book."
