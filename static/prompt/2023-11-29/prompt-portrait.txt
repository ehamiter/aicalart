A vivid representation of a Victorian gothic horror revival: looming eerie mansions amidst haunting landscapes serving as the backdrop. Picture a solemn gathering taking place under the age-old branches of an ancient olive tree. In the midst of this gathering, a square dance is unfolding with spectral figures donning the traditional attire of their respective cultures. These spectral figures encircle an orange tabby cat observing the unfolding scene from the fringes. The scene subtly intertwines symbols of peace and cultural unity. The image is crafted to fill the screen with no margins in a vertical orientation.
